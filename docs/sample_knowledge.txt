# RAG System Knowledge Base

This is a sample document for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It's a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating a response. This approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based methods.

Benefits of RAG include:
- More accurate and factual responses
- Reduced hallucinations
- Access to domain-specific knowledge
- Ability to reference up-to-date information

## How RAG Works

1. The user query is processed
2. Relevant documents are retrieved from a vector database
3. Retrieved documents are combined with the original query
4. The language model generates a response based on both the query and retrieved information

## Use Cases

RAG is particularly useful for:
- Question answering systems
- Customer support chatbots
- Research assistants
- Documentation search tools
- Knowledge management systems

This sample document demonstrates how the RAG system can retrieve and use information from documents stored in the docs directory.
